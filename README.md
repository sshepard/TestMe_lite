Completing:

When you're done:
 - cut a branch: git checkout -b yourName
 - Push it: git push origin yourName
 - Make a pull request in GitHub at https://github.com/sshepard/TestMe_lite

If you can't because you are against pulls or are all out of forks, then you can hand-write your answers on a dead tree and
shove them in an envelope (or email) to your technical contact, manager or recruiter person.
